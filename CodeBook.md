# Code Book

This is a summary of teh fields of the resulting dataset in file `tidy.txt`

## Subject
Is an identificator for each subject

## Activities

Activities type performed when the measurements were taken on each subject

* WALKING: subject was walking during the test
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* SITTING: subject was sitting during the test
* STANDING: subject was standing during the test
* LAYING: subject was laying down during the test
 
## Measures taken
 
### Time & Frequency
Prefix 't' to denote time and the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals.

### Body and Gravity
The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals

### X, Y & Z
Are the 3-axial raw signals XYZ

### Accelerometer and Gyroscope
Note by "Acc" and "Gyro" respectivly

### Jerk & Magnitude
Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain "Jerk" signals.
Also the magnitude (Mag) of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm.
